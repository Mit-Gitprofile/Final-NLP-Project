This project is a Multi-Class Text Classification System built with Machine Learning + NLP + Streamlit.
It classifies multiple sentences at once into categories such as:

🟢 Sports

🔵 Tech

🟣 Politics

🩺 Medical

🚗 Vehicles

🎓 Education

🎬 Entertainment

💰 Finance

The app is designed to be simple, interactive, user-friendly, and beginner-friendly.

🤖 Multi-Text Classification NLP Project

This project is a simple and interactive NLP-based text classification system built using
TF-IDF Vectorization, Linear SVM, and Streamlit.

It allows users to enter multiple sentences, and the model will classify each sentence into categories such as:
Sports, Tech, Politics, Medical, Vehicles, Education, Entertainment, and Finance.

📘 Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build a basic multi-class text classification app using machine learning and deploy it on Streamlit Cloud.

Users can enter multiple lines of text, and the app will instantly display the predicted category for each sentence.

⭐ Features

🔠 Multi-class text classification

📝 Accepts multiple sentences at once

📦 Pre-trained model loaded from a model.pkl file

🎨 Clean and simple Streamlit interface

🧹 Clear button to reset input

💡 Example sentences provided

🌐 Works directly in the browser via Streamlit Cloud

⚙️ How It Works
🧩 1. Text Vectorization

Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors.

🧠 2. Model Training

The classifier used is LinearSVC (Support Vector Machine).
It is trained on predefined text samples for each category.

💾 3. Model Saving

Both the TF-IDF vectorizer and the trained model are saved into a single file:
model.pkl using the pickle library.

🔍 4. Prediction in Streamlit

User enters sentences

Text is transformed using the saved TF-IDF vectorizer

Model predicts the corresponding category

🧪 Example Sentences Used in Training

⚽ Sports: "Virat Kohli hits a century"

💻 Tech: "Google launches a new AI tool"

🏛️ Politics: "Prime Minister announces a new law"

🩺 Medical: "Doctor advises regular health checkup"

🚗 Vehicles: "Tesla releases its latest electric car"

🎓 Education: "New education policy introduced"

🎬 Entertainment: "The movie became a box office hit"

💰 Finance: "Stock market reaches an all-time high"
